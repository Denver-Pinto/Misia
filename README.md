Hey there!

How many medicine stores will you contact for the rare medicines you've just been prescribed.
This project aims to solve that.

The home page will allow the user to enter the drug to be searched, the concerned nearby distance and latitude and longitude information that will be taken directly through the concerned API with an option for manual insertion of coordinates.

The medical page will act based on provided information and available databases to provide the user with appropriate information and location of the necessary stores.

In exchange for the valuable inventory information, we will provide the store with data concerning recent 30 days surrounding activity
that will help them in improving their inventory based on local need.

Thanks for reading.
